# Services


## App description:

This is the services app, and will provide the code neccesary to 
allow a user to view what each service provides them. The app 
will also allow the user to purchase the service.


## App purpose:

This app is designed to allow users to view the audit plans, and to 
purchase one (upon which they will be redirected to the 'purchase' 
page).

This app acts as a midway point between setting up an account and 
paying for an audit. This is where the user will choose what service 
to purchase.


# App contents:

This app will contain the templates, views and forms relevant to:
* Allowing an admin to create a new service
* Allowing users to see what each service provides
* Allowing users to choose which service to purchase
