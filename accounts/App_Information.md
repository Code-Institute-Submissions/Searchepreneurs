# Accounts


## App description:

This is the accounts app. This app is used for a variety of purposes:
* Allowing users to register an account
* Allowing users to login and logout of their account
* Allowing a site admin to see which users have paid for an audit and 
allowing the admin to view their site's URL
* Allowing users to reset their account's password via email


## App purpose:

This app is designed to allow users to purchase audits from the site, 
by connecting the user's account data to their purchase data.

This way, the purchase data for the audit is connected to a specific 
account, and isn't lost when the browser is closed.

In addition, by connecting the account data to the purchase data, a 
site admin can immediately see the information of who purchased an 
audit, ensuring that the admin is aware of who is in need of an audit.
